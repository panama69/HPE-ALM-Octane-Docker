# HPE-ALM-Octane-Docker
Shell script to start ALM Octane using Docker

Assumptions: 
  1) You have a Docker (http://www.docker.com) environment (docker-engine).  If not, you will need to install on your Linux machine or VM.
  
  2) You have internet access.
  
  3) You have port 8080 available.  If not you will either need to make it available or change the shell script to use some thing else in the -p <myport>:8080
